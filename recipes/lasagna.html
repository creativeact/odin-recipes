        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic and hearty Italian dish renowned for its layers of pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and gooey melted cheese. Typically baked to perfection, this savory casserole boasts 
            a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. The foundation of lasagna lies in its sheets of wide, flat pasta, traditionally made from durum wheat semolina, providing a sturdy base for the layers above. 
            The meat sauce, often featuring a combination of ground beef, pork, and veal, is simmered with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and various herbs and spices, infusing the dish with a robust and savory essence. 
            Each layer is generously slathered with béchamel sauce, a creamy concoction of butter, flour, and milk that adds a velvety smoothness to the ensemble. The final touch involves a copious amount of grated 
            mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, creating a golden-brown, bubbling crust when baked. The result is a mouthwatering, comforting dish that brings together the best of Italian culinary traditions.</p>

        <p>Served piping hot, lasagna is often enjoyed as a centerpiece for family gatherings, festive occasions, or casual dinners. Its popularity extends globally, with variations that cater to different tastes, 
            including vegetarian options with layers of spinach, mushrooms, or roasted vegetables. Lasagna not only captures the essence of traditional Italian cooking but also provides a satisfying and indulgent dining 
            experience that transcends cultural boundaries.</p>

            </ul>
            <h4>For the Lasagna</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 15-ounce container ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 cups freshly grated pecorino romano</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
                <li>1 pound mozzarella</li>
                <li> 16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sauce, heat ½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. 
                Season liberally with salt and pepper. Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. 
                Add the tomato paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt and pepper. 
                Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust the meatballs lightly with flour, shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides 
                (do not cook through) and transfer to the sauce.</li>
            <li>In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Transfer to the sauce. Simmer 1½ hours.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, pecorino Romano, parsley and all but 1 cup of the mozzarella. Season well with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly, then chop coarsely. Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles. 
                Spoon more sauce on top, then add a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers, using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce. 
                Sprinkle reserved mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
